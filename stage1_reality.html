    <h3 style="margin-top: 10px;">What kind of motion does a projectile follow?</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine a <strong>cannonball</strong> fired from a fort. After the initial explosive push, it rises, slows, and falls — all while tracing a curved path through the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now consider a <strong>cricketer</strong> on the boundary throwing the ball toward the wicketkeeper, or a <strong>footballer</strong> kicking the ball across the field.
      In all these cases, once the object is in the air, it is under the influence of only one force: <strong>gravity</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motion that follows is called <strong>projectile motion</strong>. The object moves in two dimensions — horizontally and vertically — and its path is typically a parabola.
      Our goal is to model this motion mathematically so we can predict the object's position at any time.
